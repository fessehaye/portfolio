Idiosyncrasy plays with the enigma of self-identity and personality in an impish remix of mechanical fortune tellers and classic artist’s games. Choose your answers wisely...

Can we really pin down a person’s identity and expose their inner-self by answering a few questions? In Idiosyncrasy, a randomized mashup of questions inspired by horoscopes, professional aptitude tests, Buzzfeed quizzes, online dating questionnaires, and other personality tests is paired with the surrealist artist’s game of Exquisite-Corpse—a game where segments of images are blindly mixed together to create a collaged image. The player is given the introspective opportunity to select answers that best represent them, resulting in a collaborative take away art-piece.

The questions are pulled from a bank of 8 categories that range from serious to silly. A hidden score has been assigned to each answer; the score the player gets in each category will determine which different drawings are collaged together to create the final art piece. With thousands of possible permutations, each play of the game can ask different questions and result in unique art pieces.
